"Spreading the word search Candance Owens tt page her latest post has been shadowed banned and stated this:

Two days ago, I was contacted by a high-ranking employee of the French Government. After determining this person’s position and proximity to the French couple, I have deemed this information credible enough to share publicly in the vent that something happens. 
In short, this person claims that the Macrons have executed upon and paid for my assassination. Yes, you read that correctly. More specifically, that the green light was give to a small team in the National Gendamarine Intervention Group. I am told there is one Israeli that is on this assassination squad and the plans were formalised.
Again, this person provided concrete proof that they are well placed within the French Government apparatus.
Further to this point, this person claims Charlie Kirk’s assassin trained with the French Legion 13th brigade with multi-state involvement.
Journalist Xavier Poussard’s life is also at risk. This is deadly serious. The heard of state of France apparently wants us both dead and has authorised professional units to carry this out.
I ask every person to RETWEET and share this.
I do not know who in the American government can be trusted, since this source claims our leaders are aware. But I have more specific information which is definitely verifiable, should they care to reach out to me.
To the brave official in France who did this because they were so moved by the evil of Charlie’s public execution to risk their own life – May God bless you. Truly.",1
"You Yanks have absolutely no idea what you are dealing with. 
It,s not so much the wizards of my upper classes, it is the witches we are concerned about. These liberal white witches are seriously evil and twisted. 
We working-class Brits have and want nothing to do with them.
 It is now common knowledge that the Fabian Society runs the US Democrat Party.
 It is also common knowledge that the Imperial British Empire has run the USA for over a 100 years give or take. 
So what is the story with our King then ? Why is he such a wet blanket or limp biscuit ? 
Well unless he does something extraordinary or grows a pair we want him gone. 
Defender of the Faith ?   Give me a break.
 Now here is where we are right now in Britain and the USA. Both countries have a problem with the southern border.
 In Britain the native population sits at 46 Million people. The official census last year counted 70 Million. ( some say 67, others say, 68/69 ) Even counting a population is a problem in broken Britain. 
But here is the Kicker !! 
The Supermarkets and sewage farms say that there are 96 Million people living in Britain. Yet !! The King sits and watches this country go to the dogs.
 Never has a Monarch behaved this way since the Magna Carta.",1

"I'm not married to the ACA, but these knuckleheads had over a decade to come up with a sensible alternative and they haven't done jack squat and now they're scrambling 5 weeks before subsidies expire to try and cobble together something.  They say they want this or they want that, but their voting records show all they want is to dismantle what's already there and bring us back to the days of pre-existing conditions and high risk insurance pools.  The bottom line is that America functions better when more people have access to affordable healthcare and unaffordable health insurance is just going to lead to more people dropping their insurance which raises costs for the rest of us, more sick people on the streets and spreading it to others, and uninsured people not getting healthcare and potentially unnecessarily dying.",1

Cassidy is piss weak. How much sucking up can politicians do? Cassidy should be removed.  Or alternatively make a public statement slamming this f'wit RFK.  Buy a billboard or 100. Take out some ads. But make up for this or leave the job you idiot.,1
Democrats drive up healthcare cost and somehow republicans are required to fix it. What a joke.,1
"Senator Cassidy knows better. He knows that CDC guidance is recognized as the gold standard—not only by organizations across the United States, but by governments around the world. Yet he exploits American ignorance and narrow-mindedness to evade accountability, all while kneeling to Trump and sacrificing our nation’s reputation and integrity. He's a coward for not owning his BS.",1

I guess it is time to leave youtube once and for all. I just cannot take the invasiveness of it all.",0

Why can't he get his ""fellow Republicans"" on board?  Does he try?  It's impossible to respect any of these people who allow this rogue president loose on the public in every terrible way.  Cassidy is still a sycophant.  Why are conservatives so cowardly?  Because they're cowards.  They don't want death threats, so they should resign.  Plenty of democrats get death threats and have no protection, but THEY don't back down.",1

the rhetorical lengths cassidy is going to in order to NOT address the simple question posed to him is very troublesome. dude doesn't want to be caught on camera admitting he was a damned fool to give a snake oil salesman and medical charlatan with no professional background in medicine the green light to head the CDC. goes against every principle for which himself stands as a doctor. gross. this whole administration and its legislative arm in both congress and the senate are absolutely gross.,1

That risk reduction is less than 1 % for covid and less than 1.5 % for measles. That means it overs protection for less that 15 kids per 1,000 vaccinated.",1

Cassidy is a TOTAL SELLOUT. What makes this really shitty is that he’s a doctor and knew RFK was a quack. Total POS POLITICAL ANSWER. He confirmed his nomination anyway and now he thinks he can assuage his guilt by talking to major news outlets to express his “strong concerns.” Yet I see no real action being taken to remove RFK or push back in meaningful ways against his anti-science policies. His decision to confirm RFK will lead to countless deaths in this country. So much for the hypocratic oath.,1
"Coward Cassidy. ""I won't speak against it but talk to your own doctor and don't listen to our healthcare information.""",1

"Jake!  When you asked the question, he said you asked the wrong question, and proceeded with his irrelevant talking points.  He did say that the 20% administrative and profit charge is his target for consideration.  No client of an insurance company recognizes a 20% ""overcharge"" as the source of the high and impractical insurance rates.  He is obstructing the facts, which are rarely a topic in these discussions.  Insurance for anything is a calculation of past and expected expenses.   In this issue,  health expenses are high, and to pay the providers, the patients' expenses are high.  Why are the heath expenses of US citizens high?   The OBVIOUS factor is the Covid-19 pandemic.  Medical expenses since the vaccine was freely available in 2022 are high because 1.2 million people in the US contracted Covid, got sick and unneccesarily died.  The right-wing MAGA, responding to the desires of employers avoiding disruption of their business, have created several aggressive ways to ""fight"" the pandemic, which has become an incorrect lethal attack on health care, specifically, amplifying a nascent mythology about the historically successful and implemented use of vaccination.  Objectively, the anti-vax ""cause"" did and still does result in the death of Americans; they either know the reality and are desperately defending themselves from liability or they are truly ignorant of the long and established conventions of health care in this country.  You interviewee should have been ""handled"" by the AMA (American Medical Association) who is authorized to perform peer reviews, and is responsible for the interviewees violations of his legal responsibilities to patients.  Instead, he gaslighted you with irrelevancies.

The insurance industries have ways to estimate expenses.  We could have good data on the Covid crisis, but the CDC has obscured that on its web site.  The senator's comments on Measles and Pertussis (whooping coughs) were especially disturbing.  If the present CDC guidelines are executed by physicians, the estimates by us and the insurance companies could predict tens of millions of subsequent deaths in the next few years.  That is why health insurance is an expensive problem.  Whether health expenses are paid directly by patients, by insurance companies or by the government, the result is the same.  The people of the US will pay them as payments to doctors and hospitals, or to insurance companies or as taxes.  The details of how that money flows are very practical, but has no bearing on the morbidity, mortality and suffering of those who require the health care.

That is why it is extremely important to restore the legislated systems that existed because they were created when the laws and institutions were responsive to the oversight and operations of the American people.  A mythologist like RFK is capable of indirectly killing millions MORE people.  The escape from justice experienced by the MAGA anti-vaxers,. holistic medicine and cults is resulting in a continued destruction of health institutions, research and this is an ongoing disaster being promoted in a very un-American and unconstitutional way.

The political environment of today has been confused by the enormous injection of crime and corruption.  We are seeing deliberate incompetence being used to destroy the United States, for the purpose of replacing the Constitution with the post-constitutional government of Project 2025.  The senator talked about an enigmatic 2026 plan, which involves more than the ratification of the crony-government of non-equal participants.  The administration has declared that those opposed to fascism are the ""enemies of the people.""   This week, Trump said that Democrats and Moderates should be declared to be insurrectionists and should be hung.   In terms of public health, it is already an inevitable danger that we have an RFK who is clearly capable of being another Doctor Mengele.  Although the mens rhea is obvious, It is irrelevant.  The absolute fact of increased death and suffering is too high a value to bother to establish motivations for why they are potentially bringing a genocide to the residents of the US.  It is reliably predictable because it is already in progress and THAT is why heath expenses and insurance rates are TOO HIGH  (even ignoring the realities of death and suffering).

It is significant, but also irrelevant, to note that a predominant GOP philosophy that the margins of profit are somehow considered irrelevant in the administration now.   The Senator's talking point about how the ""operations"" of services can absorb expenses regardless of the costs of doing business is the same ""flaw"" in their proposition that consumer items can be significantly reduced regardless of the arbitrary costs applied by tariffs, the new illegal commissions on all imported products.  Opinion can always be derived from facts.  Facts can sometimes be derived from opinion, which is why there are formal methods in any culture to verify competence.  They are substituting authorities of fact validated by experts with authorities of position appointed by higher authorities of position.  The pattern is so pervasive, one can only conclude that it is a fraudulent plan to accomplish goals for an elite subculture.  Corruption always results in failure, because it is inefficient, but in matters of life and death, and matters of individual economic destruction,  there is no time left to tolerate patently fraudulent crimes.  Because the principles of corruption injected in the federal government are not based on facts, these illegitimate institutions can only be restored with direct investigations, and application of justice with indictments.  Nevertheless, this administration will fall like a house of cards as soon as the major infractions are addressed.  The plethora of facts at every level is actually a distraction from the few very significant violations of the Constitution now infiltrating the entire culture of the United States.  There are many in this country who have made careers out of their general contempt.

Our time is our most important asset.  They are wasting our time.  I reserve my remaining time.",1

Here's a video from Canada (CBC) that should have gone viral when it first came out but I think it was buried by main stream media in the USA .

Capitalism at it's worst.  --  CBC News  --  Anti-vaxxers exposed: Hidden camera investigation (Marketplace)  ---  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V522Hs8E6NU  (21:37  minutes) It's well worth watching.,1

"That was really uplifting and powerful your energy and clarity are so strong, and the way you delivered your message really inspires me. 🙌",0
You got conned my friend,1
I find it funny that the Republicans keep bringing up health savings accounts. They say people will be able to pay for the medical care out of them which is true. But I don't believe you can pay your premiums from it so you're still going to have to deal with high premiums regardless.,1
"Cassidy, a RINO, lied to the people of Louisiana who voted for him on many occasions. He needs to be replaced.",1
"How about instead of these petty attempts, how bout go after the hospitals and insurance companies and come up with a fixed-rate system.",1
Just a few minutes of relaxing music can calm the heart and lighten the mind—it's a remedy that needs no prescription.,0
"Jake!! You let this despicable cowardice stand?!?!?
Cassidy abdicates his oaths as a doctor and an erected representative, refuses to man up and admit his vote to confirm Kennedy was a huge mistake, and you let this fool with zero credibility spin more BS that Repugnicans give a flying football about Americans' health and health care!!??. Jake, get some rest and come back with a little more fire.",1
"So will we each get $50,000 for healthcare.  This plan never says what it will pay people.  If it’s $2,000. That is not enough to find a plan and pay for the monthly premiums.",1
"I used to read the CDC website. NOT ANYMORE and not until our current ""health secretary"" is out of office! Why would I TRUST the CDC website while RFK Jr is sending such a twisted message about vaccines and many other peer reviewed medical treatments? 

Hearing the Republicans do an about face and act like they all of a sudden care about their constituents is seriously shocking and very, very low, especially after they refused to work with the minority party to do THE VERY SAME THING. This BS about HSA deposits to ""cover the deductible"" is also BS. Have you seen the new deductibles? I have and 1 or 2k dropped in an HSA is going to do fuck all to help cover a 12k out of pocket cost for someone who earns less than 60k a year. They have to spend 12,000.00 BEFORE insurance will pay a dime. What is 1 or 2 k going to do for those folks? They will have and pay for, USELESS insurance policies that will make even more $ for the insurance companies because the people paying for these garbage policies will be stuck paying or lose insurance entirely. Also, an HSA doesn't give the patient more control over what procedures you get. That's another lie. The insurance company still determines whether or not all HSA spending your $ on is ALLOWABLE based upon the insurance companies policies.

They do not care about the American people. They care about the PERCEPTION of the American people to NOT see through their lies and half truths and to swallow down whole, anything that they now say is the truth.",1

"Don't take health advice from POLITICIANS, ask a health care professional YOU TRUST.

to those who are getting to know their true selves for the very first time,
to everyone experiencing a new birth,
to all who have finally found their inner peace.
